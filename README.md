## About the project
Application has been developed as part of DareIT React Challenge project.
The main goal was to extend or add new features to existing source code.
Application includes Ledger where user can add expense or income.
Data are displayed in the table and on the diagrams what allows analysis of the budget.
Another main feature is Budget that displays expenses by category and provides additional data such as
date when budget has been created or ceiling for expense with summary status.
